# PESOS Projects Sample
This is a sample repository for PESOS Projects. Maintainers can use this as a baseline for their respective project repos. 

This is a sample README containing minimal sections for the projects. Additional sections can be added by maintainers, which are preferably:
* brief.  
* have the bulk of their documentation in the doc section, for particularly lengthy sections.

The first section should give an idea about the product, the problem it is trying to solve/what it aims to build and broadly, its domain(s). 

## Setting up the development environment
This section should briefly detail the tech stack used and give clear,concise instructions to set up the project and install the dependencies, if any. In the interests of keeping the README brief, this section can contain a [link](https://github.com/metonymic-smokey/pesos-projects-sample/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md) to the documentation section for this.

## Contributing to this project
This section should give a brief on how one can contribute to this project(eg. code patches, docs, testing, etc.) and contain a link to the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/metonymic-smokey/pesos-projects-sample/blob/master/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the docs.

## Communication
This could contain a link to the Slack channel(s) of the project and details for any additional forms of communication the maintainers have adopted.
