# Contributing Guidelines

This section is to guide potential contributors, mainly on the kinds of contributions they can make and if needed, the right way to make those.  
Some projects have different contributor guides for code fixes and doc fixes so your project can structure it that way if necessary.  
If needed, maintainers can also add a brief section on running tests,etc. on a new patch before submitting.
