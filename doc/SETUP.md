# Setup the development environment

This section is to guide users and contributors set up your project locally. It should contain set up/install instructions and possibly, fixes for common, minor issues that arise while during the course of the same.

A common way of structuring this is to include instructions for Linux, macOS and Windows i.e. different common platforms.

## Linux
Set up instructions for Linux.

## macOS
Set up instructions for macOS.

## Windows
Set up instructions for Linux.

A minor test to check after this if the installation is up and running is also useful.

This section can also contain commands/instructions to set it up via alternative methods(e.g. using Dockerfiles, Vagrantfiles, etc.)
